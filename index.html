        Rafat Chowdhury, also known as AR |  | Viperdae, is the elite of the team. Basically he's also one influencer to make the team. He's not a regular player but he plays mostly good. Even at least I can't tell you how he played before. Oh yeah I almost forgot, he's also an uncle of AR |  | Caspian.
